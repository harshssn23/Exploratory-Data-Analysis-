# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Implementation of EDA process for different datasets.
This repository demonstrates the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process for different datasets, showcasing essential steps such as data cleaning, outlier removal, histogram plots, heatmaps, feature selection, inferences drawn, and model selection and development.

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial phase in understanding and preparing data for further analysis and modeling. The EDA process involves several key steps to reveal patterns, relationships, and insights within the dataset.

## EDA Process Overview:

### Data Cleaning:
* Handling missing values.
* Addressing duplicate records.
* Correcting data types.

### Removal of Outliers:
* Identifying and handling outliers that might skew the analysis.
* Using statistical methods or visualizations to detect and address outliers.

### Histogram Plots:
* Visualizing the distribution of key variables through histograms.
* Understanding the central tendency and spread of the data.

### Heatmap:
* Creating a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between variables.
* Identifying multicollinearity and potential features for further investigation. 

### Feature Selection:
* Evaluating the importance of features for modeling.
* Utilizing statistical tests, correlation analysis, or feature importance from machine learning models. 

### Inferences Drawn:
* Drawing insights from the data exploration.
* Formulating hypotheses for relationships between variables. 

### Model Selection and Development:
Choosing appropriate machine learning models based on the nature of the problem (classification, regression, etc.).
Developing predictive models using selected features.
